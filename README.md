# arabic-keyboard-reverser

This is a simple helper software that helps people to type proper Arabic language in *environments that does not support Arabic*.

# How To Use ?
There are 2 ways to use it. 

## 1) pop-up window (deprecated)

**Steps:**
1. Press **Shift+Enter** anywhere and a pop-up window will appear.
2. Type your Arabic text inside the text input and then press Enter/Ok.
3. Then paste the Clipboard inside the environment that does not support arabic.
4. Done.

hint: Before pressing Shift+Enter, select the textarea inside the *environment that does not support Arabic* first. Because in this way the software paste the text from the clipboard automatically after pressing Enter/Ok.

## 2) Quick transform

**Steps:**
1. Type your Arabic text inside the textinput (ofc it will be messed up).
2. Press **Ctrl+Enter**. (fixes the Arabic text)
3. Done.

hint: This way removes the current text and paste the new text from clipboard really fast. If this proccess fails somehow, just paste the text from the clipboard you self by doing **Ctrl+V** inside the *environment that does not support Arabic-.
